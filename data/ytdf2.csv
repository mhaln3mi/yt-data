Cloud Practitioner,No one teaches like Mosh Hamedani does. What a legend 🔥
Code With Clinton,Your 6hour Python video on YouTube was where I learnt the basics of Django. I fell in love with Django and started teaching Django on my YouTube channel. Sir Mosh you are the best instructor in the world.
Sreevanth Duggirala,"Mosh, thank you so much for the countless digestible tutorials! I was able to effortlessly learn Python because of your effective teaching style. Would you be able to make a course/playlist for C++? Thanks again!"
RAYAT BIN NASIR,Incredibly video. This was really helpful. Mosh's tutorials are always so neatly arranged and skips unnecessary contents. Thank u very much for this and hope to see more tutorials. 😍
Mauvis Ledford,"One of the best, perfectly-paced, Typescript tutorials out there. Unfortunate that you don't use curly braces with your if statements. One of the biggest causes of bugs for new and even experienced JS programmers. Hubris is the only reason not to use them."
Vinicius Santana,Amazing stuff. I'm curious though on what would be your approach to setup the VSCode debugger having TypeScript installed as a dev dependency instead of a global dependency.
my kun,"Hi Mosh, The python course you teach is great but I found the content in the course very basic and it lacks many important things like decorator and multithreaded, asynchronous programming in python"
Bharat Singh,"Thanks for this amazing tutorial. I've just started learning and u made it super easy.
At 30:16 we do get those methods with javascript."
Israel,you dont need to go to Harvard to learn programming. mosh is the expert on teaching programming than any universities in the world. trust me i am witness. i used to be one of the people who dont understand coding and got lowest grade in university. but i decided to quit college and bought all his full stack courses. now i fall in love with coding and becoming the best on the field. Thanks Mosh!!
MoonSpark,"I never liked coding cause how hard it is and I watched one of your videos about python and it really helped me and made thinks easier to understand. Thanks for all the awesome content, keep it up 👏🏻"
Sayan Naskar,"Hi Mosh, can you please mention the VSCode theme that you are using in this video? It looks quite aesthetically pleasing"
Jay M,"Hello Mosh, great content, I have a quick question for you, I want to buy your course and learn JavaScript and SQL, do you recommend those two if you want a job in QA Automation? I have been watching Postman API videos as well. Thank you for your time."
